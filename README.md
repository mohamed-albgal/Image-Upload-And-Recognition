# Image Object Detection Using Yolov3

### "You Only Look Once" (YOLO) v3 is used to genereate bounding boxes around and identify images in uploaded photos

 The frontend is in React and styled with Semantic UI, and the backend is in Python and AWS Amplify

 The web app allows user authentication and a profile that shows their images they've uploaded and what was detected.

 Images are stored in S3 buckets and are processed for image recognition by the trained YOLOV3 model
